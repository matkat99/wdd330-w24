# Svelte/Auth0 Example

This project shows how to do a simple implementation of Svelte with authentication provided by Auth0 to the client and a backend server.

You should open the project then will need to run `npm install` in the root and in the server folder.

You will need to rename the two `.env` files. One on the `client` directory and the other in `server`.  You will need to put the clientId, domain, and audience values from Auth0 into the files.

Then you should open two  terminals: one for running the client (`cd client`) and one for the server ()`cd server`).

The command to start the server is `npm run start` and for the client `npm run dev`
